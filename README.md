# Better Weakened Soul
TLDR: A small addon that improves Weakened Soul, by allowing you to change size and position.

Ever tried re-applying Power Word: Shield on yourself only to forget that the Weakend Soul debuff <br> is still active, wasting precious seconds and clicks?
Then look no further for the solution to this problem! <br> BetterWeakenedSoul allows you to reposition, and resize the Weakend Soul debuff to your preferences <br> so that you will never miss it again!
